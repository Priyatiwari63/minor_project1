# ML_Project1
 Perform Explanatory Data analysis (EDA) using numpy,pandas and matplotlib and  seaborn for the below Create a lot of visualisations, identify patterns on the data based on the survived column, Age column,Fare column, Gender Column, etc Dataset link:https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data?select=train.csv
Untitled.ipynb file contains the main source code,
train file is used to train
test file is used to test the model
and predictions file is finally generated by the ML model predicting the survivors after performing self explanatory data analysis 
I used numpy,pandas,seaborn,matplotlib and SK Learn.
